          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            Sri Lanka's public transport system currently lacks a proactive and continuous monitoring mechanism for the
            safety of the driver and passengers while on the move.
          </p>

          <p>Key challenges include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Absence of real-time detection of driver fatigue and distraction, leading to unaddressed risky behavior
              during operation.
            </li>
            <li>Delays in accident prevention such as warnings or interventions come post-incident.</li>
            <li>
              Limited communication pathways between drivers, authorities, and passengers regarding safety status.
            </li>
            <li>Lack of scalable, cost-effective AI-enabled monitoring solutions tailored to local conditions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Aim</h2>
          <p>
            The SafeDriver system aims to revolutionize public transport safety in Sri Lanka by providing a
            comprehensive, AI-driven monitoring solution that bridges the gap between reactive accident reporting and
            proactive safety intervention. This system will serve as a technological backbone for modernizing Sri
            Lanka's public transport infrastructure while ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Road traffic accidents remain a leading cause of death and injury worldwide, with human error identified
              as the primary factor of most crashes. In Sri Lanka, public buses account for a significant proportion of
              road incidents, largely due to driver fatigue, distraction, and improper behavior. Despite this, most
              buses lack automated systems that can continuously monitor driver alertness or prevent accidents
              proactively.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
              SafeDriver addresses this gap by harnessing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
              combined with embedded hardware to monitor driver behavior in real-time. Using camera-based eye tracking
              and deep learning models, it detects driver drowsiness, mobile phone usage, and distraction. The system
              then issues immediate multimodal alerts to the driver (audio, buzzer, voice) and escalates warnings to
              transport authorities if unsafe behavior persists.
